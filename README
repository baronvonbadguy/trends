#Wikipedia Trends#

This is a small project to visualize wikipedia page view counts in a time series using [Processing][1].  Unfortunately this is an old project that doesn't include much documentation and may have dependency issues.  The processing community doesn't have any particularly central distribution of libraries. 

This repo is an eclipse project.  All of the dependencies should be included in the library folder, but the eclipse linking might need to be reset locally.

The gluegen and jogl native libraries will have to be replaced if you're on os x or windows.  They can be found in the library folder, or if you want the latet OpenGL bindings, download them [Here][2]

The API GET calls take forever to come back, not much I can do about that as it's just a slow service.
